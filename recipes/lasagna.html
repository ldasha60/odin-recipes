    <h2 class="second-title-recipe">Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles until just al dente.</li>
        <li>Brown the ground beef, add the pasta sauce and cook until sauce is hot and beef is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Mix ricotta with egg, salt, and pepper and set aside.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna. You’ll be doing three layers of noodles with sauce and cheese in between, alternating between
        laying the noodles horizontally and vertically. (This helps hold the layers together after baking.)</li>
        <li>Bake and allow the lasagna to rest for 10 minutes before serving otherwise it will be so gooey the slices won’t hold
        together. Serve and enjoy!</li>
