        <ol class="list">
            <li>Slice into rings.</li>
            <li>Soak in salted milk. In a medium bowl, stir 1 teaspoon of kosher salt in ½ cup of milk. Add the squid rings
                and toss. Refrigerate for 30
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Dredge. Prepare a flour mixture by whisking together 1 ½ cup all-purpose flour, ⅓ cup cornstarch, ½ teaspoon
                baking powder, ¾
                teaspoon of dry oregano, and ½ teaspoon each black pepper and cayenne. Toss a few calamari rings in the
                flour mixture
                until well-coated, then transfer them to a colander. Repeat until all the calamari is coated in the flour
                mixture.</li>
            <li>Fry and Drain. Fill a small 2.5-quart pot or saucepan with 4 inches of grapeseed oil and heat the oil to
                somewhere between 350 and 365
                degrees F. Drop one calamari ring, if the oil bubbles and forms around it and the calamari brings to float,
                the oil is
                ready. You can now cook the squid rings in batches (about 8 at a time) for 3 minutes or until golden brown.
